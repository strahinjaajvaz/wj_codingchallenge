# WebJet Coding Challenge

Fetch data about the Star Wars movies and display them. This uses SSR.

## Getting started

1. Make sure that you have Node.js and npm installed.
2. Clone the repository and get into the root folder.
3. Install the packages using the command line with `npm install`.
4. Create an instance of server.js by running `npm run webpack`.
5. Run the app using `npm run dev`

## Project Solution description

Since the movies are being given from two api's, we have to combine the results and then filter out the duplicate results.
